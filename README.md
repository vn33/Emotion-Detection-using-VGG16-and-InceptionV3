## Project Overview
Emotion detection is a vital task in the field of computer vision and has numerous applications in various domains such as human-computer interaction, security, and social media analysis. This project aims to build robust models using VGG16 and InceptionV3 architectures to classify emotions accurately.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vn33/Emotion-Detection-using-VGG16-and-InceptionV3.git
    cd emotion-detection
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up Kaggle API (if using Kaggle datasets):**
    - Ensure you have your Kaggle API key stored in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the notebook and train the models:

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook EmotionDetection.ipynb
    ```
